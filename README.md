QR Code Generator is a simple JavaScript project that lets you generate QR codes from any text or URL using Node.js.
It’s lightweight, easy to use, and great for understanding how QR generation works in backend JavaScript environments.

The project uses:

qr-image → for generating the QR code image

fs (native Node.js module) → for writing the generated image to a file

inquirer → for taking user input directly from the terminal

How to use:

Clone the repository → git clone https://github.com/nexxus314/QR-Code-Generator.git

Navigate to the folder → cd QR-Code-Generator

Install dependencies → npm install

Run the script → node index.js

Enter your desired text or URL when prompted — a QR code image will be generated and saved automatically.

This project is built with JavaScript and focuses on using Node.js modules for input, file handling, and QR code generation.
